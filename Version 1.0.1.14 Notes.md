# Order-Management-System Version 1.0.1.14 Changes
- Removed the price column from end user main (orders) page<br>
- Changed some variable names in public/ajax/admin/update-item-details.php. There were accidental overwrites due to usage of the same variable names. They were interfering with project and cost center name change in item-details-popup-window after update.<br>
- Fixed a bug caused by datepicker date format
